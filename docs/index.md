# NTM-DB

Welcome to the NTM knowledge database. This database contains information on genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species. The data is curated from scientific literature and is intended to assist researchers and clinicians in understanding the genetic basis of drug resistance in NTM.

The database is organized by species, with each species having its own page containing information on subspecies detection, drug resistance, genes of interest, and known resistance mechanisms. Use the navigation menu on the left to explore the different species covered in this database.

## NTM-Profiler

NTM-DB is used by the NTM-Profiler tool to analyze genomic data from NTM isolates. The tool identifies genetic mutations associated with drug resistance and provides a report based on the data in this database. You can use this tool using the web interface at [https://bioinformatics.lshtm.ac.uk/ntm-profiler/](https://bioinformatics.lshtm.ac.uk/ntm-profiler/) or install it locally from via [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/ntm-profiler/README.html).
